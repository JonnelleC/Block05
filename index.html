    <p1
      >Polar bears, the majestic lords of the Arctic, are one of the region’s
      most popular and charismatic species. These powerful predators, known for
      their thick fur and strong swimming abilities, primarily inhabit the sea
      ice of the Arctic Ocean

    <h1>Giraffes</h1>

    <p1
      >Both the legs and neck of the animal are extremely elongate. The body is
      short-coupled and the back is sloped upwards from the tail to the base of
      the neck. There are two ossicones, known by most as “horns” on the skull
      and a large bump in the middle of the forehead. The eyelashes are quite
      long and thick.</p1

    <p1>
      Except for a small population of the Indian lion subspecies that remains
      in the Gir Forest of northwest India, lions now live only in Africa, from
      the Sahara's southern fringe to northern South Africa. They are absent
      from equatorial areas dominated by moist tropical forest.

    <p1
      >Monkeys originated in Africa and the first group known to have reached
      South America are thought to have migrated there up to 40 million years
      ago, when the land masses were probably between 1500 and 2000 kilometres
      apart, around a quarter of the distance now.</p1

    <p1
      >Alligators are native to the United States and China. The American
      alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is found in the southeastern United
      States and a small part of northeastern Mexico. The Chinese alligator (A.
      sinensis) is native to the Yangtze River region of China.</p1
